<!-- remember to replace the website too! -->

* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an education tool for children to learn computing in a fun and interactive way.
* Scratch has drag-and-drop interfaces. Unlike text-based programming language like Java or C where you physically type every line of code, in Scratch, you can drag and drop pre-made codes and organize them into an algorithm. It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle!
* Explain why your team chose this technology for this workshop.
