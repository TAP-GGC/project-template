If you used an asset pack or any other kind of external resource, upload them here. 

If you use an asset pack or something like it, make sure you've read the copyright and if possible, create a .md file describing how you downloaded it, the license (If your asset pack/resource is Creative Commons (CC), you'll want to specify the license) and a brief description. 

Most projects won't need to do this, but if yours does you can check out how the [Space Mechanic](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Resources/Asset%20Package.md) team did theirs.
