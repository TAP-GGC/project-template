If you used an asset pack or any other kind of external resource, upload them here. 

If you use an asset pack or something like it, make sure youve read the copyright and if possible, create a .md file describing how you downloaded it, the licence (If your asset pack/resource is Creative Commons (CC), you'll want to specify the licence) and a brief description. 

Most projects won't need to do this, but if yours does you can check out how [Space Mechanic](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/NinjaTurtles/blob/main/Resources/Asset%20Package.md) did theirs
