You'll be creating a pdf/word document file detailing step by step instructions for every part of your workshop.

Those files will be uploaded inside of the tutorial folder. If you're using Scratch, you can download and reuse the CS First files/folder so you can replace the template walkthrough with links
to your own scratch game.
