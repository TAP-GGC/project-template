You'll be creating a pdf/word document file detailing step by step instructions for every part of your workshop.

Those files will be uploaded inside of the tutorial folder. 

<p><b>If you're using Scratch</b>, you can download and reuse the CS First files/folder so you can replace the template walkthrough with links
to your own Scratch game. </p>
  
If you're not using Scratch, DO NOT include the CS First folder in your repository.
