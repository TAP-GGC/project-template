You'll be creating a pdf/word document file detailing step by step instructions for every part of your workshop.

Those files will be uploaded inside of the tutorial folder. There are some example files in this folder that are intentionally left blank. 

<p><b>If you're using Scratch</b>, you can download and reuse the CS First files/folder so you can replace the template walkthrough with links
to your own Scratch game. </p>
  
If you're not using Scratch, <b>DO NOT</b> include the CS First folder in your repository.
