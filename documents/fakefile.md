You might be wondering what all these fakefile.md things are. 

Usually to create a folder on github, people will create a fake file and delete it after because you can't commit an empty folder. In your own repository,
you'll probably want to delete these files after your folders have been created AND have a file other than the fakefile.md inside of them. 

In this template, they'll be used (INCORRECTLY) to provide descriptions of what kind of things to put in every folder. But again, you might want to delete these empty files in your own repo.
